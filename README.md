Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jessica Marareni
I'm learning a little bit of coding here and there.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a website called Vac Galore. It's nothing fancy, just a project to practise my skills and get a functioning website up and running.

How to run the program
Simply click on the index.html file to open the home page and it should work from there.
